# Google-KickStart-Solutions-cpp
  Hi all, I found many people searching for Python solutions to Kick Start problems. Kick Start problems are very interesting algorithmic problems and I aim to provide the solutions to all the rounds in both CPP and Python. Especially, Python solutions are easy to go TLE but we will contribute together and find all bottlenecks of the code if there is any. Please kindly Pull request for any suggestion or possible improvements in the codes.
